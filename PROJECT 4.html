    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3> Dune;</h3>
        </li>
        <p>It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends
            life and enhances mental abilities.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>A Song of Ice and Fire</h3>
        </li>
        <p>The characters of A Song of Ice and Fire are all entangled in three primary plotlines. The first is a war that rages between the most powerful families of Westeros. The second is the ominous, more existential threat of the Others, led by the Night
            King, who rise in the wastes beyond Westeros's northern wall.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>The Three-Body Problem
            </h3>
        </li>
        <p>The series portrays a fictional past, present, and future wherein Earth encounters an alien civilization from a nearby system of three Sun-like stars orbiting one another, a representative example of the three-body problem in orbital mechanics.</p>
